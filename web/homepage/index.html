          <p>I have always wanted to get into IT.</p>
          <p>I have came across many difficulties on my travels to be come an ITer.</p>
          <p>At first i was not sure how to begin and did not know what would be the best computer language to begin with.</p>
          <p>I decided to start with linux fundementals to get the basics of computing.</p>
          <p>After i learned some linux i started my journey with Python.</p>
          <P>At first Python seemed easy, close to English would be a pice of cake.</P>
          <p>But it was only like that in the begin</p>
          <p>Then the real challenge began.</p>
          <p>After Python i had gotten bitten by the programing bug and started to learn c#.</p>
          <p>Alot of people had told me, you dare take on C#.</p>
          <p>i first thought should i or not.</p>
          <p>I decided to press on and have had lots of challenged moments.</p>
          <p>I have also done a small part of C++ and i have enjoyed it.</p>
          <p>I am now busy with CS50 and enjoying it every moment of the days that i am working on the labs and problem sets.</p>
          <p>I hope that there are a lot of people that enjoy the journey as much as i have.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much</p>
