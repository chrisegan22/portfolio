        <div>
          <p>The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003.</p>
          <p>Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source.</p>
          <p>At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products.</p>
          <p>Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language.</p>
          <p>A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.</p>
          <p>Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.</p>
          <p>As of November 2022, the most recent stable version of the language is C# 11.0, which was released in 2022 in .NET 7.0.</p>
