Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

10 and 100 simulations are the only ones that are different winners than the rest

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1000 or 10000 both are under the 1m and the difference is 0.3%.
10000 would be a better prediction but because it is cheaper if you use 1000
this would be a beter choice also because it is a minimale difference
